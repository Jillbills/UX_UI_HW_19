                    My teammates did a fabulous job creating a <strong>UX Scenario</strong> and portraying it through a well illustrated <strong>Storyboard.</strong> 
                    Manny took the lead on the <strong>Style Guide</strong> and menu <strong>Animation</strong> while Carlos ensured that our prototype was <strong>Responsive Design</strong> and he did the <strong>English - Spanish Translations.</strong> Together <strong>we utilized our skills and strengths to create a sucessful solution to our problem.</strong>

                <p>By redesigning Edúcate Ya’s website to be more visually engaging, we can help increase engagement with and participation in the organization’s classes and events.<br><br>
                    We also believe that a website that is easier to maintain for the organization and more delightful for people outside of the organization to use will result in an increase in donations to Edúcate Ya.</p>
